text = "1. Players: 2-6 players, each with a token (boot, smartphone, ship, hatstand, cat, or iron).
2. Turns: Roll two dice to move clockwise around the board. A player who rolls doubles gets another turn; rolling doubles three times sends them to jail.
3. Starting Money: Each player starts with £1,500. The bank has £50,000, and players cannot borrow money from the bank.
4. Cards: Draw “pot luck” or “opportunity knocks” cards when landing on corresponding spaces, and follow the instructions. Replace the card at the bottom of the pile.
5. Purchasing Properties: Players can buy properties after completing one full circuit of the board. Properties are purchased from the bank at listed prices.
6. Auctioning: If a property is not bought by a player, it is auctioned by the bank to the highest bidder.
7. Rent: Pay rent when landing on an owned property. Rent is higher if the owner has a full color group or if properties have houses or hotels.
8. Bankruptcy: If a player can't pay rent, they must sell assets. If they cannot pay their debts, they go bankrupt and are out of the game.
9. No Borrowing: Players cannot lend or borrow money from each other or the bank.
10. Property Development: Players can only buy houses or hotels on properties within a full color set.
11. Property Selling: Properties can be sold back to the bank for their original value, but only when no houses or hotels are on the property.
12. Mortgaging: Players can mortgage properties for half their value, but no rent is collected while mortgaged.
13. Free Parking: Fines accumulate on free parking. If a player lands on it, they collect all fines.
14. Jail Rules: Players who land in jail must pay £50 to be released or skip their next two turns. They can also use a \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card.
15. Houses and Hotels: Properties can have up to one hotel or up to four houses before building a hotel. A hotel costs the same as five houses.
16. Fines: If a player needs to raise money, they can sell assets or mortgage properties.
17. Rent with Houses: Rent increases when properties are developed with houses or hotels.
18. Auction Rules: Auctions are for properties not bought outright and must be bid on by players who have completed a circuit.
19. Banker’s Role: The banker distributes money, handles property auctions, and ensures correct transactions.
20. Jail Duration: After two turns in jail, players return to \"just visiting\" and resume normal gameplay."
